The RF Fold module is designed to allow transcriptome-wide reconstruction of RNA structures, starting from XML files generated using the RF Norm tool.This tool can process a single, or an entire directory of XML files, and produces the inferred secondary structures (either in dot-bracket notation, or CT format) and their graphical representation (either in Postscript, or SVG format).<br/>To allow higher analysis flexibility, the tool incorporates two different prediction methods:<br/>1. __ViennaRNA__<br/>2. __RNAstructure__!!! note "Note"
    Only the new ViennaRNA v2.2.0 soft-constraint approach is provided, since hard-constraint predictions are in most cases totally unreliable.
