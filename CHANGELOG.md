### API changes
- Replaced the File::Path rmtree() function with a thread-safe version (introduced in the Core::Utils library)
- Added a third parameter to the pearson() and spearman() functions from Core::Statistics to allow handling of arrays containing NaNs (when TRUE, only non-NaN elements from both arrays are kept)

- We have now avoided use of XML::LibXML for RNA Framework's XML file input handling (thread unsafe)

## [2.5.3] - 2018-02-04
### Changed
- Modified rf-fold to avoid partition function from being computed when not performing windowed folding (or when explicitly required by -dp or -sh)

### API changes
- Modified the rmpseudoknots() function to take an array of array refs of 3 elements [i, j, score], and a code ref to use to compute overall score of the helix

## [2.5.2] - 2018-01-29
### Added
- Rewritten rf-fold engine to make it faster (and to make code maintenance easier)
